# Entity-Resolution
Data Science: Text Analysis and Entity Resolution in F#

Entity resolution is a common, yet difficult problem in data cleaning and integration. 
Entity Resolution (ER) refers to the task of finding records in a dataset that refer to the same entity across different 
data sources (e.g., data files, books, websites, databases). ER is necessary when joining datasets based on entities that 
may or may not share a common identifier (e.g., database key, URI, National identification number), as may be the case due 
to differences in record shape, storage location, and/or curator style or preference. A dataset that has undergone ER may 
be referred to as being cross-linked.

Used data science techniques: Bag-of-Words, Term-Frequency/Inverse-Document-Frequency TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity.

Programming language: F#
